# Tic-Tac-Toe-using-javascript
A simple single player tic tac toe game  using javascript for the logic and html, css for frontend. Will work on any browser. After the player's turn, clicking on the board will trigger the computer's turn. No AI algorithm has been implemented, so computer will not make moves with the intention to win. Hope to implement that feature soon.
